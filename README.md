<!-- Delete Local Branch
To delete the local branch use one of the following:

$ git branch -d <branch_name>
$ git branch -D <branch_name>
The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.
The -D option is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch]
As of Git v2.3, git branch -d (delete) learned to honor the -f (force) flag.
You will receive an error if you try to delete the currently selected branch. -->
