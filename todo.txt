Multiple documents having equal search score

I'm having issues getting the right/best translation for **'hi'** from English to French. After some debugging I discovered that the first three(3) documents returned from my aggregation has the same score of **'2.362138271331787'** each.

I'm expecting **'hi'** to have a higher score since it has an exact match with the same search query, but **'it’s his'** and **'his'** seems to have the same score too with **'hi'**. 

### Here's my search query:

```js
const searchOption= [
  {
    $search: {
      text: {
        query: 'hi',
        path: 'english',
      },
    },
  },
  { $project: {  _id: 0, french: 1, english: 1, score: { $meta: "searchScore" } } },
  { $limit: 5 },
];

const result = await Greetings.aggregate(searchOption, { cursor: { batchSize: 5 } }).toArray();

````

### Here's are the documents returned. The list is ordered by search score:

```json
[
  {
    "english": "it’s his",
    "french": "c'est le sien",
    "score": 2.362138271331787
  },
  {
    "english": "hi",
    "french": "salut",
    "score": 2.362138271331787
  },
  {
    "english": "his",
    "french": "le sien",
    "score": 2.362138271331787
  },
  {
    "english": "it’s his failure to arrange his",
    "french": "c'est son incapacité à organiser son",
    "score": 2.2482824325561523
  },
  {
    "english": "it’s his failure to arrange his time",
    "french": "c'est son incapacité à organiser son temps",
    "score": 2.0995540618896484
  }
]
```
